## Business risk report
A report that will help someone integrate sepes onto a larger organisation by answering and documenting risk areas.
Based first on the questions in [Questions from an IT manager](https://github.com/equinor/sepes/wiki/Questions-from-an-IT-manager)

This rapport have the following diagrams with as much details as possible.
* One that describes what systems sepes connect to.
* One that describe who users interact with different parts of sepes.
* One that describe how data flows inside sepes and how that is controlled. This will be the most critical for sepes.

1. Sepes overview

2. Description of sepes system
   * First diagram.
3. User-flow, authentication and authorization.
   * Second diagram.

   * And questions under Data & Information Architecture
5. Development methodology.
   * And questions under Software Development & Software Architecture
6. Security documentation.

   * And any result for other rapport we have that around security.
