A platform that allows vendors prove their solutions on your data in a sandbox.

## Making commits

We use commitizen to make our commits. To make a commit, run "npm run commi" to start the questionare. We use these rules to say if a change is MAJOR, MINOR or a PATCH:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
